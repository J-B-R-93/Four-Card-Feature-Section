# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section solution

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).

# Overview

This is my 1st challenge done on Frontend Mentor challenges.
The challenged was completed using mainly FLEXBOX for the positioning of the page.
It is still missing the Desktop background svg, and the mobile version (responsive design).

# My process

-Structure the file in HTML with clear divisions using the div element. Separation between the head of the page and the cards
-Google fonts link (poppins)
-CSS properties like box-sixing, margins, paddings, borders, box-shadow, ...
-Flexbox to the container containing 3 children, left card, 2 mid cards and right card.
-Missing the background svg image and the responsive design for mobile (to be added later)
