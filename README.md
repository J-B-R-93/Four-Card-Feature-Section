# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section solution

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).

## Overview

This is my 1st challenge done on Frontend Mentor challenges.
The challenged was completed using mainly FLEXBOX for the positioning of the page.
It is still missing the Desktop background svg, and the mobile version (responsive design).

## Screenshot for the page

## My process

- Structure the file in HTML with clear divisions.
- Separation between the head of the page and the cards
- Google fonts link (poppins)
- Flexbox display
- Absolute positioning to icons inside cards
- Media queries for a responsive page
